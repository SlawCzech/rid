PROJECT_CONTEXT = """
The research project investigates consumer engagement in the context of sustainable consumption. 
Its primary scientific goal is to identify and analyze the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral aspects 
of consumer engagement and their influence on sustainable consumption behaviors.

The study assumes that consumers’ everyday purchasing decisions, although seemingly minor, have 
significant cumulative effects on environmental and social sustainability. Therefore, a deeper 
understanding of consumer engagement — including pro-environmental and pro-social dimensions — 
is essential for promoting more sustainable lifestyles.

The project will:
1. Define and characterize consumer engagement in sustainable consumption, focusing on emotional, 
   cognitive, and behavioral dimensions.
2. Explore how pro-environmental and pro-social engagement are related to overall sustainable behaviors.
3. Identify determinants that stimulate or inhibit engagement in sustainable consumption.
4. Develop a conceptual and methodological framework for measuring such engagement.
5. Propose behavioral interventions that can effectively increase consumer involvement 
   in sustainable and responsible consumption practices.

The project combines theoretical exploration with practical application. It uses a mixed-methods approach 
— including literature review, qualitative interviews (IDI, FGI), and quantitative surveys (CAWI) — 
to produce both academic insights and policy recommendations. 

Ultimately, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how emotional, cognitive, 
and behavioral factors interact to shape consumer engagement in sustainability, 
and how this engagement can be strengthened to support sustainable development goals.

LITERATURE_CONTEXT = """
Recent literature reinforces the multidimensional nature of consumer engagement — emotional, cognitive, and behavioral.
Scholars emphasize both internal determinants (values, motivation, pro-environmental attitudes) 
and external determinants (social norms, company actions, public policy).
Studies (e.g., Kadic-Maglajlic, Salnikova, Piligrimienė) show that consumer engagement is a key enabler 
of sustainable consumption practices.
Further findings highlight:
- The role of organizational image and CSR in enhancing engagement.
- Contextual factors (cultural, political, infrastructural) that facilitate or limit pro-environmental behaviors.
- The integration of pro-environmental and pro-social engagement as complementary dimensions.
- Conceptual tensions such as greenwashing or information overload.
This literature suggests that understanding engagement requires an interdisciplinary lens — behavioral economics, 
psychology, and sociology — and must capture both ecological and social aspects of sustainability.
